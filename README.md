This project builds a simple **Q-Learning agent** to solve the classic **Frozen Lake** environment from OpenAI Gym.

The lake is slippery. The goal is to reach the frisbee at the goal tile (`G`) without falling into the icy holes (`H`). The agent learns using a **Q-table** by exploring different paths on a 4x4 grid.
